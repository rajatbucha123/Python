Q = 1) Write a Python program to find those numbers which are divisible by 7 and multiple of 5, between 1500 and 2700 (both included). 

a=[]

for i in range(1500,2700):
    if(i % 7 == 0) and ( i % 5 == 0):
        a.append(i)

print(a)

Q=2) Python Program to Check if a Number is Positive, Negative or 0

num = int(input("Enter the numer"))

if num > 0:
    print("It is positive number")
elif num == 0:
    print("it is zero")
else:
    print("it is negative number")
    
 Q= 3) Python Program to Check if a Number is Odd or Even
 
 num = int(input("Enter the number "))

if num% 2 == 0:
    print("it is even number")
else:
    print("it is odd number")
    
Q = 4)  Python Program to Check Leap Year

year = int(input("Enter the number "))

if(year%4)== 0:
    if(year% 100)==0:
        if(year%400)== 0:
            print("it is leap year",format(year))
        else:
            print("it is not leap year",format(year))
    else:
        print("it is leap year",format(year))
else:
    print("it is not leap year",format(year))
    
Q= 5) Python Program to Find the Largest Among Three Numbers

num1 = int(input("Enter the first number "))
num2 = int(input("Enter the second number "))
num3 = int(input("Enter the third number"))

if num1 >= num2 and num1 >= num3 :
    print("it is greater than num1")
elif num2 >= num3 and num2 >= num1 :
    print("it is greater than num2")
elif num3 >= num1 and num3 >= num2:
    print("it is greater than num3 ")
else:
    print("all are equal")
Q= 6) Using following list of cities per country,
india = ["mumbai", "banglore", "chennai", "delhi"]
pakistan = ["lahore","karachi","islamabad"]
bangladesh = ["dhaka", "khulna", "rangpur"]
Write a program that asks user to enter a city name and it should tell which country the city belongs to
Write a program that asks user to enter two cities and it tells you if they both are in same country or not.
For example if I enter mumbai and chennai, it will print "Both cities are in India" but if I enter mumbai and dhaka it should print "They don't belong to same country".


i) india = ["mumbai", "banglore", "chennai", "delhi"]
pakistan = ["lahore","karachi","islamabad"]
bangladesh = ["dhaka", "khulna", "rangpur"]

country = input("Enter the number:\n")

if country in india:
    print(f"{country} is a Indian")
elif country in pakistan:
    print(f"{country} is a Pakistani")
elif country in bangladesh:
    print(f"{country} is a bangladesi")
else:
    print("Based on limitled knowledge")

ii) india = ["mumbai", "banglore", "chennai", "delhi"]
pakistan = ["lahore","karachi","islamabad"]
bangladesh = ["dhaka", "khulna", "rangpur"]

country1 = input("Enter the city 1:\n")
country2 = input("Enter the city 2:\n")

if country1 in india and country2 in india:
    print("Both city in india")
elif country1 in pakistan and country2 in pakistan:
    print("Both city in pakistan")
elif country1 in bangladesh and country2 in bangladesh:
    print("both city in bangladesh")
else:
    print("They don`t belong same country")
